## [DEMO](https://vivianeasley.github.io/space-madness/)

This is a digital single player version of Space Madness the Board Game that has been changed in a couple of ways to take advantage of the fact that the computer can manage much of the game and setup. There are a couple of minor known cross-browser visual bugs but otherwise it should be completely playable.
